#CSS Layout
## Learn CSS - Flexbox
### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
Flexbox is only meant for rows or columns, not both.
### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
The main axis is the one identified by the flex-direction property so it can be either row or column it just depends on what it is set to. The cross axis is the row opposite the function.
### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Things like row-reverse or column-reverse reorder the visual display but not in the HTML document so the logical order is reversed and not visual order and the screen reader will follow the logical content.

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
"Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent."
"Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available."
"Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content."
