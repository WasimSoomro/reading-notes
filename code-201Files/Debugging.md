# Debugging
## Troubleshooting JavaScript
### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Spelling errors in the code that prevent the program from running. Logic errors are errors where the rogram runs but the result is not what is intended.
### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
Something along the lines of a variable not being defined and then going back and defining the variable properly or declaring it. Logic errors, currently my totals for the salmon lab are not summing when a new line is added.
### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
It's foundational to strong coding skills to be able to debug well!
## The JavaScript Debugger
### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The JavaScript debugger helps you to closely inspect your code as it compies to help identify changing value of variables and set breakpoints to see exactly where the code goes awry. 
### Define what a breakpoint is.
A place in the code where the programmer intends to have execution paused.
### What is the call stack? 
Shows you what code was executed to get to the current line in the code.
