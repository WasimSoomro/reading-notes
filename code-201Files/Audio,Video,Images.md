### Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
Certain browsers might not be compatabile with the provided video format. Fallback content can redirect the user to a working link or at least inform them the video is not working.
### Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters. 
Once upon a time there were two friends, \<audio> and \<video>. They both travelled the world together. They realized that when they were together more people were drawn to them. By themselves, they felt incomplete.
