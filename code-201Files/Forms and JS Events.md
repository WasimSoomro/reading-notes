### How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
"Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them." https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events
### When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
The type of event and the function to be executed. 
### Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
The target property tells you what created the event and the event object is created when an event occurs.
### What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
"Event bubbling describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements." 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events
Event capturing is the opposite of event bubbling in terms of the way the event flows.
