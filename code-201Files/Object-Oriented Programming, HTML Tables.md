# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables
## Domain Modeling
### Explain why we need domain modeling.
Domain modeling helps with creating efficient code and scaling in the future. It focuses on the first step of understanding what the problem is and how it will be solved. 
## HTML Table Basics
### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
"Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users." Tables also cause far more complex and tags than established layout techniques. Header, section, article, and div are automatically responsive since their width defaults to 100% of their parent element. 
Tables are not automatically responsive:

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
- <td> elements, for table data
- <tr> elements, for table rows
- <th> elements, are table header elements that go at the start of a row or column
## Introducing Constructors
### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
A constructor is a faster way to create a new object. It is "a function called using the new keyword."

### How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
In constructors "this" is usedful since it is creating "more than one object from a single object definition" in constructors.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
Prototypes allow "us to share methods across all instances of a funciton." 
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
