# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout
## HTML
### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
Wrap text inside an \<a> element, and use the href attribute.  
### The href attribute contains what information?
The href attribute contains information on the web address.
### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
Add alternative text to images so that screen readers can pick on them. Text or audio transcripts can help.
## CSS Layout
### What is meant by “normal flow”?
Normal flow refers to the way items on an HTML webpage sit if their layout has not yet been manually changed. 
### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
Block-level eleemnts are laid out in block-flow direction. Each element appears on a "new line before the last one." Inline elements sit on the same line as long as the parent block has width/space available. 
### ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
Static positioning.
### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
It is not in the "normal flow" of the document, it sits separately so can have separate UI features.  
### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
Fixed positioning fixes an element in place "relative to the visible portion of the viewport" but absolute positoining "fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor."
## Learn JS
### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation. Declaring a function is setting it up but not actually calling it. Invoking a function is calling the function to actually run it. 
### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
Some functions need paraameters or values inside them to be specified when invoked. "Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definitions. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initialized to the value of the arguments supplied. 
## Pair Programming
### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
It can produce higher quality code and actually be more effieicent as mistakes are initially caught and higher levels of code can be created. Explaning the code out loud also helps an individual learn it better.
