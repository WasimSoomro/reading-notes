# State and Props
## React Lifecycle
### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
Render happens first.

### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
Render phase. Mounting/constructor.

### Put the following things in the order that they happen: 
Constrcutor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount componentWillUnmount, 
What does componentDidMount do?

## Props
### What types of things can you pass in the props?
Initial count in a counter application, props are things you pass to the function, what you want to initialize the component to.
### What is the big difference between props and state?
State is inside the component, props are passed into a component, props are handled outside a component. 
### When do we re-render our application?
Based on something the user has done. Store it in state. 
### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
Things that are handled only in the component, nowhere outside the component.
