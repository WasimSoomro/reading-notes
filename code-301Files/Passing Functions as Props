# Passing Functions as Props
## React Docs - lists and keys
### What does .map() return?
Returns a new array after calling a function on every element of the previous array.
### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
Use .map() using {}
### Each list item needs a unique ____.
Each list item needs a unique key.
### What is the purpose of a key?
"Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed."
## The Spread Operator
### What is the spread operator?
Useful "for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments." 

### List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
- Add items to arrays
- Combine arrays
- Combine objects
- Spread an array out into a function's arguments

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
