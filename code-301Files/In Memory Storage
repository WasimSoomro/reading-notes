### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
One call at a time
### What does LIFO mean?
Last in first out, last function pushed into the call stack is the first one out
### Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
Main program starts, function A calls B, B calls C, C executes is popped out, B executes is popped out, A executes is popped out, main program finishes.
